- Update Makefile to account for needing to pass a version
- Figure out a way to stub out the version file as part of the application directory
- CI is using "release a library" from shared-docker. That either needs to be renamed or we need a release an application container
- Check Makefile against ponyup/stable/corral for other possible changes that are needed as current was based off the library version
- Update templated README to include how to install via Docker
- Update templated README to include how to install via Cloudsmith
- CI nightly builder is using ponyup ci builder. Need to move to shared and update.
- Document that the Dockerfile needs to be filled out as part of setup information
- Add assumptions about being able to use standard build image for nightlies and releases.
